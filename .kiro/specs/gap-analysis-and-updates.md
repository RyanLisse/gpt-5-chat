### Specs Needing Design and Tasks
4. **AX Framework Integration** - Requirements only
5. **Predictive Maintenance** - Requirements only
6. **Augmented Reality Integration** - Requirements only
7. **Multi-Language Support** - Requirements only
8. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Requirements only
9. **Enhanced Offline Synchronization** - Requirements only

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Missing Integration Points
- **Voice ↔ RAG Integration**: How voice queries connect to advanced RAG
- **Responses API ↔ AX Framework**: Integration between OpenAI and AX-LLM
- **Offline ↔ Voice**: Offline voice capabilities specification
- **Analytics ↔ All Systems**: How analytics integrates with each component

### 2. Missing Technical Specifications
- **Database Schema**: No detailed database design for any component
- **API Contracts**: Missing API interface definitions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Specific performance targets per component
- **Security Architecture**: Cross-component security design

### 3. Missing Development Workflow
- **Git Worktree Setup**: Specific instructions for each feature
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Testing and deployment automation
- **Code Quality Gates**: Linting, formatting, type checking
- **Documentation Standards**: API docs, user guides, troubleshooting

### 4. Missing Deployment Considerations
- **Environment Configuration**: Development, staging, production
- **Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal and vertical scaling plans
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Comprehensive observability
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and recovery procedures

## Priority Updates Needed

### Immediate Priority (Week 1)
1. **AX Framework Integration** - Design and Tasks
2. **System Integration Architecture** - Cross-component design
3. **Database Schema Design** - Unified data model
4. **Development Workflow Setup** - Git worktrees, CI/CD

### High Priority (Week 2)
1. **Predictive Maintenance** - Design and Tasks
2. **Enhanced Offline Synchronization** - Design and Tasks
3. **Security Architecture** - Cross-component security
4. **Performance Benchmarking** - System-wide performance targets

### Medium Priority (Week 3)
1. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Design and Tasks
2. **Multi-Language Support** - Design and Tasks
3. **Monitoring and Observability** - System-wide monitoring
4. **API Documentation** - Comprehensive API specs

### Lower Priority (Week 4)
1. **Augmented Reality Integration** - Design and Tasks
2. **Deployment Architecture** - Production deployment
3. **User Documentation** - End-user guides
4. **Training Materials** - Developer onboarding

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Create System Integration Architecture
Before completing individual specs, create a unified system architecture that shows:
- Component interactions and dependencies
- Data flow between systems
- Shared services and utilities
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, monitoring)

### 2. Standardize TDD and Vertical Slice Patterns
Ensure all specs follow the same patterns:
- Consistent complexity ratings (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Standard TDD test structure with Vitest
- Vertical slices with clear deliverables
- Integration points clearly defined

### 3. Define Shared Infrastructure
Create specifications for shared components:
- Database schema and migrations
- Authentication and authorization
- Logging and monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization

### 4. Create Development Standards
Establish consistent development practices:
- Code organization and structure
- Testing strategies and coverage
- Documentation requirements
- Review and approval processes

## Next Steps

1. **Create System Integration Architecture** - Unified design document
2. **Complete AX Framework Integration** - Design and tasks
3. **Update Remaining Specs** - Add design and tasks to all specs
4. **Create Shared Infrastructure Specs** - Database, auth, monitoring
5. **Establish Development Workflow** - Git worktrees, CI/CD, standards

This gap analysis provides a roadmap for completing all specifications with proper TDD practices, vertical slices, and system integration considerations.
