COPY BUTTON LOGIC (2+ implementations):\n   - CodeBlockCopyButton in ai-elements/code-block.tsx\n   - ButtonCopy in common/button-copy.tsx\n   - Both use same pattern: navigator.clipboard.writeText, useState for copied state, Check/Copy icons\n\n3. INPUT COMPONENTS (potential overlap):\n   - /components/ui/chat-input.tsx: Chat-specific input with LexicalChatInput wrapper\n   - /components/ai-elements/prompt-input.tsx: More generic prompt input with form elements\n   - Similar structures but different purposes\n\n4. MODEL MANAGEMENT (some overlap):\n   - /lib/ai/all-models.ts: Main model definitions and logic\n   - /lib/ai/legacy-models.ts: Simple legacy model definitions\n   - Different purposes but some conceptual overlap\n\n5. DOCUMENT COMPONENTS (similar patterns):\n   - /components/read-document.tsx: Simple read document display\n   - /components/document.tsx: More complex document tool result with interactions\n   - Similar styling patterns: \"flex w-fit items-center gap-3 rounded-xl\"\n\nMINOR DUPLICATIONS:\n- Icon imports from lucide-react scattered across many files\n- Repeated className patterns: \"rounded-xl border bg-background\" etc.\n- Similar button patterns with tooltips\n- Consistent use of cn() utility from /lib/utils.ts (good - centralized)\n\nCONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES:\n1. Merge code block implementations\n2. Create shared copy button component\n3. Standardize input component patterns\n4. Create shared document display components\n5. Create icon utilities/constants",

Fixed Next.js 15.x configuration by using correct serverExternalPackages syntax \n3. Addressed database graceful degradation - app has built-in mock client for when POSTGRES_URL unavailable\n4. Found comprehensive .env.local file with all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Supabase DB, etc.)\n5. Application server starts successfully in 4 seconds on port 3000\n6. No configuration warnings anymore\n\n🔄 CURRENT STATUS:\n- Dev server running successfully\n- No critical errors in startup\n- Main compilation issue resolved\n- Environment properly configured\n- Ready for testing chat functionality\n\nThe major compatibility blockers have been resolved.

The parsing logic looks correct: \"responseId = parsed.data || parsed.id\" should handle { responseId } structure\n4. However, the API sends data: { responseId } so frontend should access parsed.data.responseId instead\n\nISSUE IDENTIFIED: Frontend parsing at line 507 should be:\n- Current: responseId = parsed.data || parsed.id\n- Should be: responseId = parsed.data?.responseId || parsed.data || parsed.id\n\nThis would properly extract responseId from the { responseId } object structure sent by API.",
