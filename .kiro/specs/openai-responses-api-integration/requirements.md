# OpenAI Responses API Integration Requirements

## Introduction

The OpenAI Responses API Integration replaces the traditional Chat Completions API with OpenAI's most advanced API interface. This integration provides native RAG capabilities through built-in file search and web search tools, stateful conversation management, enhanced streaming, and multimodal input/output support. This upgrade is essential for building robust, agentic applications with improved reliability and reduced complexity.

## Requirements

4. WHEN conversations become too long THEN the system SHALL manage context efficiently while preserving important information

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Streaming Capabilities

**User Story:** As an operator, I want real-time streaming responses with lower latency, so that I can get immediate feedback during critical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use the Responses API's optimized streaming for improved responsiveness
2. WHEN streaming responses THEN tool invocations and results SHALL be streamed in real-time
3. IF streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle partial responses and resume when possible

**User Story:** As a technician, I want to submit both text and images in a single request, so that I can get comprehensive assistance for visual equipment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting queries THEN the system SHALL accept both text and image inputs simultaneously
2. WHEN processing multimodal inputs THEN the system SHALL analyze images in context with text queries
3. IF images contain equipment diagrams THEN the system SHALL identify components and provide relevant documentation
4. WHEN multimodal responses are generated THEN they SHALL reference both textual and visual information sources

### Requirement 5: Built-in Web Search Integration

**User Story:** As a maintenance engineer, I want the system to access current web information when local documentation is insufficient, so that I can get up-to-date technical information and solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local documentation doesn't contain sufficient information THEN the system SHALL automatically use web search tools
2. WHEN web search is performed THEN results SHALL be clearly marked as external sources
3. IF web search finds relevant information THEN it SHALL be integrated with local knowledge base results
4. WHEN web search is used THEN the system SHALL prioritize authoritative technical sources and manufacturer websites

### Requirement 6: Advanced Tool Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want seamless integration of multiple tools within single conversations, so that complex queries can be resolved through coordinated tool usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries require multiple tools THEN the system SHALL coordinate file search, web search, and custom functions automatically
2. WHEN tools are invoked THEN their outputs SHALL be integrated seamlessly into the final response
3. IF tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and clear error messages
4. WHEN custom functions are defined THEN they SHALL integrate with built-in tools through the unified Responses API interface

### Requirement 7: Response Quality and Citations

**User Story:** As a safety officer, I want all AI responses to include proper citations and source attribution, so that I can verify information and ensure compliance with safety standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responses are generated THEN they SHALL include detailed citations for all factual claims
2. WHEN file search is used THEN citations SHALL include document names, sections, and relevant passages
3. IF web search provides information THEN citations SHALL include URLs, publication dates, and source credibility indicators
4. WHEN multiple sources are used THEN citations SHALL be clearly distinguished and ranked by relevance

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling for API failures, so that the system remains reliable even when external services experience issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide user feedback
3. IF tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative approaches or provide partial responses
4. WHEN service degradation occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to cached responses or reduced functionality

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized API usage to minimize latency and costs, so that the system operates efficiently at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use response_id references to minimize payload sizes
2. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN frequently accessed responses SHALL be cached locally
3. IF multiple similar queries are made THEN the system SHALL optimize by reusing relevant context
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN API usage metrics SHALL be tracked for cost optimization

### Requirement 10: Migration from Chat Completions API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a smooth migration path from the existing Chat Completions API, so that I can upgrade without disrupting current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing code THEN it SHALL be updated to use the Responses API patterns incrementally
2. WHEN both APIs are in use THEN they SHALL interoperate during the transition period
3. IF migration issues arise THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN all functionality SHALL be preserved or enhanced

### Requirement 11: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want enhanced security features for sensitive industrial data, so that proprietary information remains protected during AI processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use encrypted reasoning items for enterprise privacy
2. WHEN storing conversation state THEN it SHALL comply with data retention and privacy policies
3. IF background processing is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same security standards as real-time processing

4. WHEN cost optimization is important THEN service tier settings SHALL be configured based on urgency requirements

### Requirement 13: Integration with Existing Components
