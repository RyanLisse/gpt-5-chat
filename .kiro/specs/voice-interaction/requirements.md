# Voice Interaction System Requirements

## Introduction

The Voice Interaction System provides hands-free, real-time voice communication capabilities for the RoboRail Assistant. This feature enables operators and technicians to interact with the system using natural speech while keeping their hands free for equipment operation. The system leverages OpenAI's advanced speech models and the AI SDK for seamless speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.

2. WHEN the conversation becomes complex THEN the system SHALL summarize key points verbally
3. IF I interrupt the assistant while it's speaking THEN it SHALL stop and listen to my new input
4. WHEN voice conversations are long THEN the system SHALL provide periodic summaries to maintain clarity

### Requirement 5: Voice Command Recognition

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to use specific voice commands for common actions, so that I can quickly navigate and control the system without complex phrases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I say predefined commands like "Show maintenance schedule" THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding action
2. WHEN voice commands are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification with suggested options
3. IF I use custom voice shortcuts THEN the system SHALL learn and remember them for future use
4. WHEN new voice commands are added THEN they SHALL be discoverable through voice help commands

### Requirement 6: Audio Quality Optimization

**User Story:** As a field technician working in various acoustic environments, I want consistent audio quality, so that voice interactions remain reliable regardless of location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio input quality is poor THEN the system SHALL apply noise reduction and enhancement automatically
2. WHEN multiple people are speaking THEN the system SHALL focus on the primary speaker
3. IF audio feedback or echo occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and eliminate it automatically
4. WHEN using different microphone types THEN the system SHALL auto-calibrate for optimal performance

### Requirement 7: Voice Interface Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with hearing impairments, I want visual feedback for all voice interactions, so that I can use the voice system effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is being processed THEN visual indicators SHALL show transcription in real-time
2. WHEN the assistant speaks THEN the text SHALL be displayed simultaneously with highlighting
3. IF voice recognition fails THEN clear visual error messages SHALL be provided
4. WHEN using assistive devices THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with hearing aids and other equipment

### Requirement 8: Voice Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want voice interactions to be processed securely, so that sensitive operational information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice data is processed THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
2. WHEN voice recordings are stored THEN they SHALL be automatically deleted after 30 days unless explicitly saved
3. IF voice data contains sensitive information THEN it SHALL be flagged and handled according to security policies
4. WHEN voice processing occurs offline THEN no voice data SHALL be transmitted to external servers

### Requirement 9: Performance and Latency

**User Story:** As an operator needing immediate assistance, I want voice interactions to be fast and responsive, so that I don't experience delays during critical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak a command THEN the system SHALL begin processing within 200ms
2. WHEN generating voice responses THEN the first words SHALL be spoken within 1 second
3. IF network latency is high THEN the system SHALL use local processing to maintain responsiveness
4. WHEN voice processing is slow THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion times

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user of the RoboRail Assistant, I want voice interactions to work seamlessly with all existing features, so that I have a consistent experience across all interaction methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using voice to search documentation THEN results SHALL be presented both audibly and visually
2. WHEN voice interactions generate citations THEN they SHALL be announced and displayed appropriately
3. IF voice commands trigger multimodal responses THEN images and diagrams SHALL be described verbally
4. WHEN switching between voice and text input THEN conversation context SHALL be maintained seamlessly

### Requirement 11: Voice Analytics and Improvement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want insights into voice interaction patterns, so that I can optimize the system and identify areas for improvement.
