# AX Framework Integration Requirements

## Introduction

The AX Framework Integration enables the RoboRail Assistant to leverage the AX LLM framework for building robust, type-safe, and self-optimizing AI agents. AX provides advanced features including typed prompt signatures, streaming validation, DSPy-inspired optimization, and native RAG capabilities that will enhance the assistant's reliability and performance.

## Requirements

4. WHEN generating responses THEN AxRAG SHALL stream results with proper citation tracking

### Requirement 3: Typed Prompt Signatures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define prompts using AX's typed signatures, so that I can ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors from unexpected LLM outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining prompts THEN they SHALL use AX signature syntax with input/output type specifications
2. WHEN LLM responses are processed THEN they SHALL be automatically parsed and validated against signature types
3. IF type validation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with corrected prompts or provide fallback responses
4. WHEN prompt signatures are updated THEN existing code SHALL maintain compatibility through version management

### Requirement 4: Self-Optimizing Agents

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want AI agents to improve their performance automatically, so that the system becomes more accurate and efficient over time without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents interact with users THEN they SHALL collect feedback and performance metrics automatically
2. WHEN sufficient training data is available THEN AX optimizers SHALL improve prompt effectiveness using DSPy patterns
3. IF agent performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger reoptimization processes
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN they SHALL be A/B tested before full deployment

### Requirement 5: Streaming Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As an operator, I want real-time validation of AI responses, so that I receive accurate information immediately without waiting for complete response generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI responses are being generated THEN they SHALL be validated incrementally during streaming
2. WHEN validation errors are detected THEN the system SHALL correct them in real-time or restart generation
3. IF streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle partial responses and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN users SHALL receive immediate confirmation of response reliability

### Requirement 6: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system designer, I want to create complex workflows using multiple specialized agents, so that I can handle diverse tasks efficiently with appropriate expertise for each domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries are received THEN the system SHALL route them to appropriate specialized agents
2. WHEN agents need to collaborate THEN they SHALL communicate through AX's agent composition patterns
3. IF agent handoffs are required THEN context SHALL be preserved and transferred seamlessly
4. WHEN multi-agent workflows complete THEN results SHALL be consolidated and presented coherently

### Requirement 7: Zero-Dependency Architecture

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the AX integration to maintain minimal dependencies, so that I can deploy and maintain the system with reduced complexity and security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AX THEN it SHALL not introduce additional heavy dependencies beyond core requirements
2. WHEN deploying the system THEN AX SHALL work with existing TypeScript and Node.js infrastructure
3. IF dependency conflicts arise THEN AX SHALL provide clear resolution paths or alternatives
4. WHEN updating AX THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guides

### Requirement 8: OpenTelemetry Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability of AI agent operations, so that I can monitor performance, debug issues, and optimize system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents operate THEN they SHALL emit OpenTelemetry traces for all operations
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN detailed telemetry SHALL help identify bottlenecks and root causes
3. IF agents fail or produce errors THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available for debugging
4. WHEN analyzing system performance THEN telemetry data SHALL integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure

### Requirement 9: Production-Ready Reliability

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want AX-based agents to meet industrial reliability standards, so that the system can operate continuously in critical manufacturing environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN they SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN system load is high THEN agents SHALL gracefully degrade performance while maintaining core functionality
3. IF external services are unavailable THEN agents SHALL fall back to cached responses or offline capabilities
4. WHEN reliability metrics are measured THEN they SHALL meet or exceed 99.9% uptime requirements

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AX framework integration to work seamlessly with existing RoboRail Assistant components, so that I can migrate incrementally without disrupting current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AX THEN existing OpenAI API calls SHALL be gradually migrated to AX patterns
2. WHEN AX agents are deployed THEN they SHALL interoperate with existing voice, multimodal, and offline components
3. IF migration issues arise THEN the system SHALL support hybrid operation with both old and new implementations
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN all functionality SHALL be preserved or enhanced

### Requirement 11: Custom Optimization Strategies

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want to define custom optimization strategies for industrial use cases, so that AI agents can be fine-tuned for specific manufacturing and maintenance scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining optimization goals THEN they SHALL be specific to industrial documentation and safety requirements
