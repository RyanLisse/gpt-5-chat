# Predictive Maintenance Feature Requirements

## Introduction

The Predictive Maintenance feature leverages AI-driven analytics to analyze equipment sensor data and predict potential failures before they occur. This feature integrates with HGG Systems to collect real-time sensor data from RoboRail machinery and uses OpenAI's advanced models to detect anomalies and generate maintenance recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Data Collection

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want the system to continuously collect sensor data from RoboRail equipment, so that I can monitor equipment health in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is connected to HGG Systems THEN it SHALL collect sensor data every 30 seconds
2. WHEN sensor data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in the time-series database with proper timestamps
3. IF the connection to HGG Systems fails THEN the system SHALL retry connection every 60 seconds and log the failure
4. WHEN sensor data exceeds normal operating ranges THEN the system SHALL flag it for immediate analysis

### Requirement 2: Anomaly Detection

**User Story:** As a maintenance manager, I want the system to automatically detect anomalies in equipment behavior, so that I can address issues before they cause downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL analyze it using OpenAI's anomaly detection capabilities
2. WHEN an anomaly is detected THEN the system SHALL calculate a confidence score between 0 and 1
3. IF the confidence score is above 0.8 THEN the system SHALL generate an immediate alert
4. WHEN multiple anomalies are detected within 24 hours THEN the system SHALL escalate the priority level

### Requirement 3: Maintenance Predictions

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want to receive AI-generated predictions about when equipment will need maintenance, so that I can schedule maintenance proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL generate maintenance predictions with estimated timeframes
2. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL include recommended actions and parts that may be needed
3. IF a prediction indicates maintenance needed within 7 days THEN the system SHALL create a high-priority maintenance ticket
4. WHEN predictions are generated THEN they SHALL be stored with audit trails for compliance tracking

### Requirement 4: Integration with Documentation

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want predictive maintenance alerts to include relevant documentation links, so that I can quickly access repair procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maintenance prediction is generated THEN the system SHALL search the knowledge base for relevant procedures
2. WHEN relevant documentation is found THEN it SHALL be included in the maintenance alert with direct links
3. IF no specific documentation is found THEN the system SHALL provide general maintenance guidelines
4. WHEN documentation links are provided THEN they SHALL be verified to ensure they are current and accessible

### Requirement 5: Dashboard and Reporting

**User Story:** As a maintenance manager, I want a dashboard showing equipment health trends and predictions, so that I can make informed decisions about maintenance scheduling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the predictive maintenance dashboard THEN it SHALL display current equipment health status
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL show prediction accuracy metrics over time
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include cost savings from prevented downtime
4. IF equipment health deteriorates THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight affected equipment with visual indicators

### Requirement 6: Machine Learning Model Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the predictive models to improve over time based on actual maintenance outcomes, so that predictions become more accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maintenance is completed THEN the system SHALL record the actual outcome against the prediction
2. WHEN prediction accuracy data is available THEN the system SHALL use it to improve future predictions
3. IF model performance drops below 85% accuracy THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN model updates are available THEN the system SHALL implement them during scheduled maintenance windows
