# Augmented Reality Integration Requirements

## Introduction

The Augmented Reality (AR) Integration feature provides immersive, hands-free access to technical documentation and real-time guidance through AR devices. This feature overlays digital information onto the physical RoboRail equipment, enabling operators and technicians to access contextual information without looking away from their work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AR Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want to use AR glasses to view equipment information while working, so that I can keep my hands free and maintain focus on the equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using supported AR devices THEN the system SHALL display documentation overlays on equipment components
2. WHEN AR devices are connected THEN the system SHALL automatically detect device capabilities and adjust interface accordingly
3. IF AR device battery is low THEN the system SHALL provide visual and audio warnings
4. WHEN multiple AR devices are in use THEN the system SHALL support concurrent sessions without interference

### Requirement 2: Equipment Recognition

**User Story:** As an operator, I want the AR system to automatically recognize RoboRail components I'm looking at, so that I can get relevant information without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pointing AR device at equipment THEN the system SHALL identify components using computer vision
2. WHEN components are identified THEN the system SHALL overlay component names and basic information
3. IF component recognition confidence is below 90% THEN the system SHALL prompt for manual confirmation
4. WHEN new equipment is installed THEN the system SHALL learn and recognize new components after training

### Requirement 3: Contextual Information Display

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want to see relevant documentation and procedures overlaid on equipment, so that I can follow instructions while performing maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking at a component THEN the system SHALL display relevant maintenance procedures as AR overlays
2. WHEN following step-by-step procedures THEN the system SHALL highlight the next action area on the equipment
3. IF safety warnings exist for a component THEN they SHALL be prominently displayed in red overlays
4. WHEN procedures are completed THEN the system SHALL mark steps as complete and advance to the next step

### Requirement 4: Voice Integration

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to control the AR interface using voice commands, so that I can interact with the system while my hands are busy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using voice commands THEN the system SHALL respond to predefined commands for navigation and information retrieval
2. WHEN voice commands are unclear THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification using audio feedback
3. IF background noise interferes with voice recognition THEN the system SHALL switch to gesture-based controls
4. WHEN voice commands are processed THEN the system SHALL provide audio confirmation of actions taken

### Requirement 5: Real-time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a remote support engineer, I want to see what the on-site technician sees through their AR device, so that I can provide real-time guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remote support is requested THEN the system SHALL stream the AR view to remote engineers
2. WHEN remote engineers provide guidance THEN their annotations SHALL appear in the on-site technician's AR view
3. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL reduce video quality to maintain real-time communication
4. WHEN collaboration sessions end THEN the system SHALL save session recordings for training purposes

### Requirement 6: Safety and Compliance

**User Story:** As a safety officer, I want AR overlays to include safety warnings and compliance information, so that workers follow proper safety protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN approaching hazardous areas THEN the system SHALL display safety warnings and required PPE
2. WHEN performing regulated procedures THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance steps are followed and documented
3. IF safety protocols are not followed THEN the system SHALL prevent procedure continuation and alert supervisors
4. WHEN safety incidents occur THEN the system SHALL automatically record the context and notify emergency contacts

### Requirement 7: Offline Capability

**User Story:** As a field technician, I want AR functionality to work without internet connectivity, so that I can access critical information in remote locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to provide basic AR functionality using cached data
2. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL sync data and session logs when connectivity is restored
3. IF critical updates are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize downloading them when connection is available
4. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate limited functionality to users

### Requirement 8: Performance and Battery Optimization

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want the AR system to run efficiently throughout my work shift, so that I don't experience interruptions due to performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AR applications are running THEN they SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS for smooth user experience
2. WHEN device temperature rises THEN the system SHALL reduce processing intensity to prevent overheating
3. IF battery level drops below 20% THEN the system SHALL enter power-saving mode with reduced features
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize settings and notify users of changes
