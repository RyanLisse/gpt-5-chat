# Offline Synchronization Requirements

## Introduction

The Offline Synchronization feature ensures that the RoboRail Assistant maintains full functionality in factory environments with limited or unreliable internet connectivity. This feature enables seamless operation by caching critical data locally and synchronizing changes when connectivity is restored, ensuring continuous access to documentation and AI assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Offline Data Caching

**User Story:** As a factory operator, I want the system to work without internet connectivity, so that I can access critical information even when network connections are unreliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects internet connectivity THEN it SHALL automatically cache essential documentation and AI models locally
2. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL provide access to all cached documentation and basic AI functionality
3. IF storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize caching based on usage frequency and criticality
4. WHEN cache updates are available THEN they SHALL be downloaded automatically during low-usage periods

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Content Prioritization

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want the most relevant documentation to be available offline, so that I can perform my job effectively without internet access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining cache priorities THEN the system SHALL analyze user roles, historical usage, and scheduled maintenance
2. WHEN cache space is limited THEN safety-critical and frequently accessed content SHALL be prioritized
3. IF new equipment is installed THEN related documentation SHALL be automatically prioritized for caching
4. WHEN user patterns change THEN cache priorities SHALL be updated to reflect new usage patterns

### Requirement 3: Offline AI Capabilities

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to ask questions and get AI assistance even when offline, so that I can troubleshoot issues without waiting for internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL provide AI responses using locally cached models and knowledge
2. WHEN offline AI capabilities are limited THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate reduced functionality
3. IF complex queries require online processing THEN they SHALL be queued for processing when connectivity returns
4. WHEN offline responses are generated THEN they SHALL be marked as offline-generated for quality tracking

### Requirement 4: Seamless Connectivity Transitions

**User Story:** As a field technician, I want the system to automatically handle connectivity changes without interrupting my work, so that I can focus on my tasks rather than technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch to offline mode without user intervention
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume online functionality and sync pending data
3. IF connectivity is intermittent THEN the system SHALL optimize for offline operation to avoid constant switching
4. WHEN transitioning between modes THEN ongoing conversations and work sessions SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 5: Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a maintenance manager, I want all offline activities to be synchronized when connectivity returns, so that I have complete visibility into field operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN all offline queries, responses, and user actions SHALL be synchronized to the server
2. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts intelligently and preserve user work
3. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and alert users of persistent issues
4. WHEN large amounts of data need syncing THEN the process SHALL be optimized to minimize bandwidth usage

### Requirement 6: Offline User Authentication

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want user authentication to work offline, so that system security is maintained even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL authenticate users using cached credentials and biometric data
2. WHEN authentication tokens expire offline THEN the system SHALL use secure local validation methods
3. IF security policies require online validation THEN users SHALL be warned about limited offline access
4. WHEN connectivity returns THEN authentication status SHALL be validated and updated as necessary

### Requirement 7: Offline Content Updates

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to ensure that critical updates reach offline users as soon as possible, so that they have access to the latest safety and operational information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical updates are published THEN they SHALL be flagged for priority synchronization to offline devices
2. WHEN devices come online THEN they SHALL check for and download critical updates before other content
3. IF updates contain safety information THEN users SHALL be notified immediately upon synchronization
4. WHEN updates are applied offline THEN version tracking SHALL ensure consistency across all devices

### Requirement 8: Storage Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient storage management for offline data, so that devices don't run out of space while maintaining essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage space is low THEN the system SHALL automatically remove least-used cached content
2. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL never remove safety-critical or currently needed content
3. IF storage optimization is needed THEN users SHALL be able to manually select content to keep offline
4. WHEN storage usage is monitored THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts before space becomes critically low

### Requirement 9: Offline Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an operator using the system offline, I want it to perform as well as when online, so that my productivity isn't impacted by connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating offline THEN response times SHALL be comparable to or better than online performance
2. WHEN processing offline queries THEN the system SHALL use optimized local algorithms and cached data
3. IF performance degrades offline THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize resource usage
4. WHEN measuring offline performance THEN metrics SHALL be tracked and used to improve future offline experiences

### Requirement 10: Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a technician who may work offline while others work online, I want the system to handle conflicts intelligently when my changes are synchronized, so that no important information is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronization conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL present clear options for resolution
2. WHEN conflicts involve safety-critical information THEN they SHALL be escalated for manual review
3. IF automatic conflict resolution is possible THEN it SHALL preserve the most recent and complete information
4. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN all affected users SHALL be notified of the changes

### Requirement 11: Offline Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all offline activities to be properly logged and audited, so that we maintain regulatory compliance even during offline operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating offline THEN all user actions SHALL be logged locally with timestamps and user identification
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN offline audit logs SHALL be synchronized and integrated with online logs
3. IF audit logs become corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue for investigation
4. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN offline activities SHALL be included with appropriate annotations

### Requirement 12: Network Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing limited bandwidth, I want the synchronization process to be efficient and configurable, so that it doesn't interfere with other critical network operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the system SHALL use compression and delta synchronization to minimize bandwidth usage
2. WHEN network bandwidth is limited THEN synchronization SHALL be throttled to avoid impacting other operations
3. IF synchronization is interrupted THEN it SHALL resume from where it left off rather than starting over
4. WHEN configuring sync settings THEN administrators SHALL be able to set bandwidth limits and priority schedules
