# Multi-Language Support Requirements

## Introduction

The Multi-Language Support feature enables the RoboRail Assistant to serve users who speak different languages, providing localized interfaces, documentation, and voice interactions. This feature supports HGG Profiling Equipment's global operations by making technical documentation accessible in multiple languages while maintaining accuracy and context.

## Requirements

4. WHEN new UI elements are added THEN they SHALL be marked for translation in all supported languages

### Requirement 2: Document Translation

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want technical documentation to be available in my preferred language, so that I can understand procedures and safety instructions clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting documentation THEN the system SHALL provide it in the user's selected language if available
2. WHEN translations don't exist THEN the system SHALL use AI translation while clearly marking content as machine-translated

4. WHEN switching languages THEN voice models SHALL update to match the new language selection

### Requirement 4: Multilingual Search

**User Story:** As a technician, I want to search for information using terms in my native language, so that I can find relevant documentation quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL be displayed in the user's preferred language
3. IF search terms are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions in the user's language
4. WHEN using technical terms THEN the system SHALL understand both localized and international terminology

### Requirement 5: Cultural Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user from a different cultural background, I want the system to respect cultural conventions in date formats, units, and communication style, so that information is presented in a familiar way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN users want to change languages THEN they SHALL be able to do so with a single click from any screen
3. IF users mix languages in queries THEN the system SHALL detect the primary language and respond accordingly
4. WHEN language preferences are changed THEN they SHALL be saved for future sessions

### Requirement 8: Offline Language Support

**User Story:** As a field technician working in remote locations, I want language support to work offline, so that I can access localized information without internet connectivity.
